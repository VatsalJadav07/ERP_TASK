## Getting Started

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    cd ERP
    npm install
    ```

### Configuration:

1. **Install MongoDB:**

   - [Download and Install MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) on your machine.

2. **Set up a Cloud-based MongoDB instance (optional):**

   - If you prefer, you can use a cloud-based MongoDB service such as [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas). Follow their documentation to create an account and set up a cluster.

3. **Configure MongoDB Connection:**

   Create a MongoDB configuration file (e.g., `db.js`) in the root of your project:

   ```javascript
   // db.js
   const mongoose = require('mongoose');
   const dbUrl = mongodb-link; // Update the path based on your project structure

4. **Postman Setup**

       - Import the provided Postman collection located at [path/to/your/PostmanCollection.json](path/to/your/PostmanCollection.json). This collection includes pre-configured requests             for testing your APIs.

    **Configure Environment (optional):**

       - If your APIs require environment-specific variables, consider configuring a Postman environment. Update the environment variables accordingly.
